# Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition


  
In this project, we have used Face Recognition System to mark the attendance.
  
We have used Python libraries such as OpenCV, dlib and face_recognition.
  
We have formed a dataset (folder named "Images") where we are pre registering the pictures of persons with their name as the filename.
  
  
Requirements:

Recognize and manipulate faces from Python with the world's simplest face recognition library.
Built using dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 96.7% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.

This also provides a simple face_recognition tool that lets you do face recognition on a folder of images !
  
Steps of Execution:
    
  1. Install Opencv library.
  2. Install dlib library (Remember to first install dlib library before installing face_recognition). 
  3. Install face_recognition. 
  4. Drop the person's pictures with their name as filename in the "Images" folder before running the code.
  5. Run the test.py file.
